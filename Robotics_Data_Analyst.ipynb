        "In this activity, you are taking on the role of a Data Analyst for a Robotics Tournament. Your job is to clean up messy information about teams, matches, scores, and workshops so the event can run smoothly. You’ll decide which Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets) are the best tools for different tasks—like sorting schedules, adding up scores, or checking for mistakes. Just like a real analyst, you’ll need to think carefully about how to organize data so it’s accurate, efficient, and easy to use.<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Your audience for this is someone who doesn't know about code, but wants to see how you got your results. They don't just want to see you write a paper with no supporting code to back it up, but they also don't want to see a big block of code with no support explanation. <br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "A key part of your job is to do the analysis, but also to explain your work. The final report should be a very intentional mix of code with text. **You should not have giant blocks of code**. For example, a function should be its own code block. Every 4-6 lines should include some explanation of what you are doing. That's just a rough estimate though. Think about your code in terms of discreet chunks. Each chunk should be a code block."
