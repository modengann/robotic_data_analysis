        "In this activity, you are taking on the role of a Data Analyst for a Robotics Tournament. Your job is to clean up messy information about teams, matches, scores, and workshops so the event can run smoothly. You’ll decide which Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets) are the best tools for different tasks—like sorting schedules, adding up scores, or checking for mistakes. Just like a real analyst, you’ll need to think carefully about how to organize data so it’s accurate, efficient, and easy to use.<br><br>\n",
